# Chatbot-Mini-project-
StudyBot is a simple Python-based chatbot designed to help students with basic question-answer interactions. The chatbot uses Flask for the backend, HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend, and Pandas for reading and processing predefined question-answer data from a CSV file.

It allows students to:

Interact with the chatbot via a user-friendly web interface.

Receive instant answers based on the dataset provided.

Experience a lightweight and fast local chatbot solution.

Frontend:

HTML (for structure)

CSS (for styling, including blur effects and corner-based "About Us" section)

JavaScript (to handle user input and display bot responses dynamically)

Backend:

Python (Flask): For handling requests and processing logic

Pandas: To read a .csv file containing questions and answers

Data Handling:

A CSV file acts as a mini database for storing predefined question-answer pairs.
